# Postgres Operator

We have installed the Postgres Operator from [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) to serve our persistent database needs.

## Installation of the operator via default yaml

First attempt to install the operator used:

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.26/releases/cnpg-1.26.1.yaml
```

Got a timeout error:

And note the main failure seems to be in `pod/cnpg-controller-manager-74d454fcb7-9mwvj`, which describe shows with the following error:

```

```

The logs for that pod indicate that it can't create a `Pooler` resource:

```

**Deleted everything from the `cnpg-system` namespace to start again.**

Alternatives include using the cnpg plugin for kubectl or the helm chart (which seems to be in development).

## Install using `kubectl cnpg`

Try generating custom manifests, and then apply them:

```
kubectl cnpg install generate --help
kubectl cnpg install generate > cnpg-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f cnpg-operator.yaml
```

This resulted in a number of errors because of conflicts between the client-side and server-side management of objects, so I retried with `--server-side --force-conflicts` to at least run through the whole `apply` successfully.

```
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f cnpg-operator.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts

```

Now, the `cnpg-controller-manager-7fffcb6d86-6hphr` pod seems to have started and is running successfully. Because CNPG 1.27.0 was released the day I was doing all of this, I also now see that the successful install via `kubectl cnpg` was for version 1.27.0, whereas the failure was for version 1.26.1, so that could have been the difference.

## Use of the operator

Use of the operator means definining and creating a postgres cluster for an application, which CNPG picks up and creates for us. Attempting to create with a yaml like this, using either `csi-cephfs-sc-ephemeral` for testing or `csi-cephfs-sc` for a production storage class:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: keystore-pg
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    storageClass: csi-cephfs-sc
    size: 5Gi
```

After applying that chart, it took a few minutes to come up, but then was operational quickly as seen in the `kubectl cnpg status keystore-pg` output:

```
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f postgres-cluster.yaml -n keycloak
cluster.postgresql.cnpg.io/keystore-pg created

‚ùØ k8 cnpg status keystore-pg -n keycloak

## Deleting a cluster

Once the cluster is up and running, it can be quickly deleted with:

```
‚ùØ k8 delete Cluster keystore-pg -n keycloak
cluster.postgresql.cnpg.io "keystore-pg" deleted
```

Shortly thereafter, CNPG takes down all of the running pods and services.

## Accessing the cluster

Assuming we didn't delete the cluster above, it can be accessed using `psql` by exec'ing into the cluster pods, or via postgres database connections on port 5432 to the services that were created. Here's an example of accessing the pod via psql:

```sh
kubectl -n keycloak exec -it keycloak-pg-1 -- psql
Defaulted container "postgres" out of: postgres, bootstrap-controller (init)
psql (17.5 (Debian 17.5-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \l

           |          |          |                 |         |       |        |           | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)

postgres=# \c app
You are now connected to database "app" as user "postgres".
app=# \d
Did not find any relations.
```

Note that the login is to the `postgres` admin user and database, and that CNPG created a default `app` database. More configuration is needed to control the name and type of the databses created on startup.

## Create database with initdb bootstrap

We can also set various database options for naming the application database and role, as well as database creation options. 
Below we add configuration to enable `initdb` to bootstrap a specific `keycloak` database and role. This required creating a `basic-auth` secret rather than an `Opaque` secret. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#basic-authentication-secret and https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/bootstrap/#bootstrap-an-empty-cluster-initdb

First the secret needs to be created. the `username` and `password` keys are required, but others can be added as well. Like all secrets, `data` keys are set to base64-encoded strings.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
metadata:
  name: keycloak-pg
data:
  username: a2V5Y2xvYWs=
  password: c29tZV9zZWN1cmVfcHdfNF9zdXJl
```

Once that secret is in place, create the cluster with:

```
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: keycloak-pg
spec:
  instances: 3
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: keycloak
      owner: keycloak
      secret:
        name: keycloak-pg
      encoding: UTF8
      localeProvider: icu
      icuLocale: en_US
      localeCType: en_US.UTF-8
      localeCollate: en_US.UTF-8
  storage:
    storageClass: csi-cephfs-sc
    size: 5Gi
```

Now the database is named `keycloak` and other DB options have been set:

```
‚ùØ k8 cnpg psql keycloak-pg -n keycloak
psql (17.5 (Debian 17.5-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

## Connect to the database

Once the database is up and running, you can connect to one of the services from within the cluster, using standard cluster DNS names.

The services you may want to connect to include `rw`, `ro`, and `r` instances. For example, for keycloak, these are:

- `keycloak-pg-rw`: primary instance of the cluster (read/write)
- `keycloak-pg-ro`: secondary replica instance (read-only)
- `keycloak-pg-r`:  other read replicas of the cluster (read-only)

From outside of the cluster, you can port forward port 5432 to one of these services and access it locally:

```sh
# First Port-forward in another terminal using:
#   k8 -n keycloak port-forward service/keycloak-pg-rw 5432:5432
‚ùØ psql -h localhost -U keycloak

## Database backups

CloudNativePG now supports both [hot and cold backups](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/backup/). For hot backups, it supports both a CNGP-I plugin to use external backup systems like Barman to backup to an object store, or CSI Volume snapshots.  For this initial use case, it is simplest to focus on [volume snapshots](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/appendixes/backup_volumesnapshot/) for the backup and WAL files. By default, the backup uses online hot snapshots, which should work great for us. Once a backup has been completed, we will need to work to be sure the volume snapshot is preserved for an appropriate retention time.

Because backups can be intensive, we can request that backups be made against a replica service rather than the primary, which reduces load on the rw service.

Configuration involves providing an instance of the `ScheduledBackup` resource. A typical configuration might look like this:

```
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: ScheduledBackup
metadata:
  name: keycloak-pg-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 0 * * *"  # At midnight every day
  backupOwnerReference: self
  cluster:
    name: keycloak-pg
  method: volumeSnapshot
```
