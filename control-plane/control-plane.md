# Control Plane Configuration

Up to: [DataONE Cluster Overview](../cluster-overview.md)

The Kubernetes control plane is a replicated set of services that controls all cluster services, and sits behind a load balancer to provide fault tolerance. It is configured as a "Stacked" typology, with each control plane node also hosting one of the replicas of the `etcd` configuration service.
