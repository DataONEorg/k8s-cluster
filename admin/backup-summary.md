[^1]: [Restic](https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/NCEAS/Computing/blob/master/server_backup_restic.md), in turn, backs up `datateam:/mnt/ceph/.snap/` to servers at the NCEAS office

[^2]: In the dev cluster, some ceph subvolumes are backed up via rsync. Some ae not backed up at all. See the [Server Backup List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFOFQ1lF90BoFLYRkpBRSNj5QqVyfG2DLnwc1znaNI4/edit?usp=sharing) for details.

[^3]: Weâ€™re using the S3 API with our own Object Storage server `s3.anacapa.nceas.ucsb.edu` for backups (currently MinIO on top of ZFS, probably changing soon)

[^4]: K8s admins can do a full or partial `velero restore` ([by using filtering options](https://velero.io/docs/main/resource-filtering/))
